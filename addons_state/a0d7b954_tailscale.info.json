When not set, this option is enabled by default."},"accept_routes":{"name":"Accept routes","description":"This option allows you to accept subnet routes advertised by other nodes in your tailnet. When not set, this option is enabled by default."},"advertise_exit_node":{"name":"Advertise as an exit node","description":"This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an exit node. By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN. When not set, this option is enabled by default."},"advertise_connector":{"name":"Advertise as an app connector","description":"When you use an app connector, you specify which applications you wish to make accessible over your tailnet, and the domains for those applications. Any traffic for that application is then forced over the tailnet to a node running an app connector before egressing to the target domains. When not set, this option is enabled by default."},"advertise_routes":{"name":"Advertise subnet routes","description":"This option allows you to advertise routes to subnets (accessible on the network your device is connected to) to other clients on your tailnet. When not set, the add-on by default will advertise routes to your subnets on all supported interfaces."},"log_level":{"name":"Log level","description":"Controls the level of log details the add-on provides. This only applies to the add-on itself, not Tailscale."},"login_server":{"name":"Login server","description":"This option allows you to specify a custom control server for this Tailscale instance, for example, a self-host Headscale instance. By default, it uses the control server provided by Tailscale."},"share_homeassistant":{"name":"Share Home Assistant with Serve or Funnel","description":"This option allows you to enable Tailscale Serve or Funnel features to present your Home Assistant instance with a valid certificate on your tailnet or on the internet. When not set, this option is disabled by default."},"share_on_port":{"name":"Share on port","description":"This option lets you specify which port the Tailscale Serve and Funnel features will use to present your Home Assistant instance on the tailnet and on the internet. Only ports 443, 8443, and 10000 are allowed by Tailscale. When not set, port 443 is used by default."},"snat_subnet_routes":{"name":"Source NAT subnet routes","description":"This option allows subnet devices to see the traffic originating from the subnet router, and this simplifies routing configuration. To support advanced Site-to-site networking (eg. to traverse multiple networks), you can disable this functionality. When not set, this option is enabled by default."},"stateful_filtering":{"name":"Stateful packet filtering","description":"This option enables stateful packet filtering on packet-forwarding nodes (exit nodes, subnet routers, and app connectors), to only allow return packets for existing outbound connections. When not set, this option is disabled by default."},"tags":{"name":"Tags","description":"This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this Tailscale instance. They need to start with `tag:`."},"taildrop":{"name":"Taildrop","description":"This option allows you to enable Taildrop, a file sharing service that allows you to share files with other Tailscale nodes. When not set, this option is enabled by default."},"userspace_networking":{"name":"Userspace networking mode","description":"This option allows you to enable userspace networking mode. If you need to access other clients on your tailnet from your Home Assistant instance, disable userspace networking mode, which will create a `tailscale0` network interface on your host.
